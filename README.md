## Eddie - EHD Start Theme - Emptyhead Designs
===

Hi. I'm a starter theme called `Eddie` based on `_s`.

I've added a bunch and pulled a bunch of stuff out of the original `_s` theme, purely based on the way I like to work and the tools that I use. This theme isn't for everybody, but if you like it, feel free to use it. If you don't like it... That is fine too, it wasn't built for you.

My ultra-minimal CSS might make me look like theme tartare but that means less stuff to get in your way when you're designing your awesome theme. Here are some of the other more interesting things you'll find here:

* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
* A helpful 404 template.
* A custom header implementation in `inc/custom-header.php` just add the code snippet found in the comments of `inc/custom-header.php` to your `header.php` template.
* Custom template tags in `inc/template-tags.php` that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.
* Some small tweaks in `inc/template-functions.php` that can improve your theming experience.
* A script at `js/navigation.js` that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for CSS artistry. It's enqueued in `functions.php`.
* 2 sample CSS layouts in `layouts/` for a sidebar on either side of your content.
* Smartly organized starter CSS in `style.css` that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.
* Like `_s` the theme is licensed under GPLv2 or later.
